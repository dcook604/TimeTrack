# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup with Context7

This document explains how to set up MCP with Context7 integration for the Timetracker project.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools. It allows the AI to access real-time information and perform actions outside of its training data.

## Context7 Integration

Context7 is a tool that provides real-time access to documentation, codebases, and other contextual information. It helps AI assistants understand the current state of projects and provide more accurate assistance.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install MCP Server

The MCP configuration is already set up in `mcp.json`. The server will be installed automatically when needed.

### 2. Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
# Context7 Configuration
CONTEXT7_API_KEY="your-context7-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Get Context7 API Key

1. Visit [Context7](https://context7.com)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Generate an API key
4. Add the API key to your `.env` file

### 4. Verify Setup

The MCP server will automatically start when you use Cursor with this project. You can verify it's working by:

1. Opening Cursor
2. Checking the MCP status in the bottom status bar
3. Testing context7 functionality in your conversations

## Usage

Once set up, you can use context7 in your conversations by:

- Asking for documentation updates
- Requesting real-time project information
- Getting current codebase context
- Accessing external documentation

## Configuration Files

- `mcp.json`: MCP server configuration
- `.cursorrules`: Cursor-specific rules and context7 integration instructions
- `.env`: Environment variables (create this file locally)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that your `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Verify the MCP server is running in Cursor
3. Restart Cursor if needed
4. Check the Cursor logs for any error messages

## Benefits

With Context7 integration, you get:

- Real-time access to project documentation
- Current codebase context
- External documentation integration
- Improved AI assistance accuracy
- Better project understanding

## Next Steps

After setting up Context7:

1. Test the integration by asking for project-specific information
2. Use context7 to get real-time documentation updates
3. Leverage the enhanced context for better development assistance
